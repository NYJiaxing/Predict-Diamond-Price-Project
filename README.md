# Predict-Diamond-Price-Project
## Objectives
The aim of this project is to find an appropriate model to predict the diamondâ€™s price based on the data from internet. There data mining algorithms will be applied to predict the diamonds, Linear Regression, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Neural Network, the use of these methods will be compared by the end of the report.

## Content
This repository contains following documents:
 * Three Jupyter notebooks contains three machine learning modeling I used to predict the price
 * The final report I complete to expalin the pipe line of how I finish this porject
 * Addition materials
